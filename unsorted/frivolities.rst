'<Why Waiting is Torture http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/why-waiting-in-line-is-torture.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all>`_

::

    Americans spend roughly 37 billion hours each year waiting in line. The dominant cost of waiting is an emotional one: stress, boredom, that nagging sensation that one’s life is slipping away. The last thing we want to do with our dwindling leisure time is squander it in stasis. 

It's a peculiar kind of mindset that views time left to one's own thoughts as time wasted.

    I'd fallen back in love with moments in small, dark clubs when a DJ puts on a piece of music that not only can you not identify but that until you heard it, you could not have conceived of it existing. In contrast to live concerts where bands predictably string together the songs from their most recent album, DJs have the potential to blindside you, be genuinely surprising. As a music producer, the parameters of dance music seem wider. The rhythmic underpinnings are liberating rather than constraining, allowing the rest of the elements to coalesce from a broad palette.

My experiences in writing complex CSS consist mostly of glomming together a bunch of things that don't do what I want and googling frantically until something works. The resulting clean up is basically a game of jenga where I remove "padding: 0"'s and the like until I have minimal working code again. The CSS box model is the worst
