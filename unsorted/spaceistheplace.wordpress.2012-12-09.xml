		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This post is based on sections 4.1 &amp; 4.2 of Barr and Wells, <em>Category theory for computing science</em>
Some preliminary definitions:

<strong>Quiver </strong>- Directed multigraph. See <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quiver">http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quiver</a> . Barr&amp;Wells call this a "graph"

<strong>Diagram </strong>- A quiver homomorphism.

<strong>Commuting diagram </strong>- A quiver homomorphism (diagram) where the target quiver is the underlying graph of a category and where for any two points in the source graph, any two different paths between them get mapped (via the diagram) to two paths in the underlying graph that commute in the category.

<strong>Model</strong> - A diagram (not necessarily commutative) from a quiver G to (the underlying graph of) <strong>Set</strong>. Barr &amp; Wells invent, as an example of a model, a "u-structure", which is a set equipped with a unary function on the S. Then a diagram from a graph with one node and a self-arrow to the category <strong>Set</strong> is a "u-structure", so  the diagram is called a <strong>model</strong> of a u-structure. They later broaden this definition from <strong>Set</strong> to any category.]]></content:encoded>
